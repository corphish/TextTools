### Text unsaved numbers in WhatsApp
Often we find ourselves needing to text/send file/share location to someone for temporary purposes (if you ask me, I face this a lot in situations where I go to a printing centre where they ask me to share the file that I want to print over WhatsApp, so I have to save their contact, refresh my WhatsApp contact list and then send them). Having a context menu option to directly open a WhatsApp chat from their phone number would save a lot of time and keep your phonebook clean, right?

### Evaluate mathematical expressions inline
We may often find ourselves to mathematically calculate something while texting someone (probably while making plans). Having an option to perform math calculations in line without needing to open calculator could save time.
