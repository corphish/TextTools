Collection of useful text related tools that can be accessed from the context menu that appears on text selection. The feature list will keep on growing. Let me know if you have any ideas.

### Current Features
- __Text unsaved numbers in WhatsApp__ - Often we find ourselves needing to text/send file/share location to someone for temporary purposes (if you ask me, I face this a lot in situations where I go to a printing centre where they ask me to share the file that I want to print over WhatsApp, so I have to save their contact, refresh my WhatsApp contact list and then send them). Having a context menu option to directly open a WhatsApp chat from their phone number would save a lot of time and keep your phonebook clean, right?

- __Evaluate mathematical expressions inline__ - We may often find ourselves to mathematically calculate something while texting someone (probably while making plans). Having an option to perform math calculations in line without needing to open calculator could save time.

- __Transform text__ - Transform the selected text inline. Supported transformations include changing the case, wrapping it with text etc.
