Collection of useful text related tools that can be accessed from the context menu that appears on text selection. The feature list will keep on growing. Let me know if you have any ideas.

### Variants
Since one of the functions of the app is to provide additional options in the text selection context menu, some users may want all of the options to be available at once for easy access while others may prefer a clean context menu. For this, we have 2 variants of the app. Functionalities remain same across all the variants.
- __Multiple Options__ (default) - This variant shows all of the supported options at once in the text selection context menu.

Helpful if fast access to the options is required. In order to download this, download the _app-release.apk_ from [releases page](https://github.com/corphish/TextTools/releases/latest).

- __Single Option__ - This variant shows a single option in the text selection context menu which reveals all the supported functions when clicked.

Helpful if the text selection context menu needs to be clean and clutter free. In order to download this, download the _app-release-single.apk_ from [releases page](https://github.com/corphish/TextTools/releases/latest).

### Installation warning
While installing the app (you have to side load), Google Play may block the installation saying it has never seen the app before. While it is true (from Google Play POV), you can proceed with installing the app. If you have doubts about the app being malicious, you are free to verify the same from the source code (it would not be open-source if the app was malicious in the first place, right?).

### Issues
Issues may be observed as in the contextual menu options may not be available inside certain apps, or the functionalities may not work as expected. In such cases, kindly raise issue in this Github repo.
